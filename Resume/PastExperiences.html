                    <p>My experiences with computers are constantly improving. I learnt about computers and technology at a young age, because I was fascinated and intrigued by technology, how they worked? what hardware/ software is needed to operate and how many games can be played. My early experiences with computers continued into my high school, where, studied Multimedia and Software. I made software applications such as a mini-game, calculator and a card game. My Multimedia studies have allowed me to gain a better understanding of web development, as we learnt the fundamentals of web pages.</p>
                    <p>During the Multimedia class, one of the projects was to create a web page using Adobe Muse, I made a website about my favourite soccer team Chelsea. The creation of a web page was created without HTML code. After the project, I did some research and learn the basics of HTML code and created an elementary webpage. This, however, was visually pleasing, this was because CSS was not applied.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I have proficient of knowledge and experience about information technology. The foundation of my skills and knowledge was acquired after completing multiple projects, which essential to the understanding of the web, technology and computer science..</p>

                <p>Currently studying Application programming to gain experience and develop necessary skills. The Java projects include small practice code such as (Cash register with basic I/O on the console to store and handle stock on hand, money received, the project applies additional classes such as Store, Item).</p>
                <p> A large java project of a timetable software for students to enrol in subjects and activities (classes of the subject). The software application uses complex classes and lists to store data via encapsulation. The software has functions such as a log-on system for students to enrol in subjects and activities, withdraw, view activities and subjects enrolled. The software has four main classes University, Student, subject and activities, each class is related to different attributes and relationship of the classes, for example, the university has students and subjects, a student enrols in a subject, a subject has activities. The project uses a basic console I/O system.</p>
